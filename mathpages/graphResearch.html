Given a graph \(G\) with \(n\) vertices, a subset \(S \subset V(G)\) is called \(\textbf{halfcomplete}\) if
\(|S| =\frac{n}{2}\) and the subgraph induced by \(S\) is a Complete graph.
</div>

Given a finite set \(S\) of size \(n\), then the setpower graph of \(S\) contains a halfcomplete.

<div class="lemma">
Given a finite set \(S\) of size \(n\), then if there is an induced subgraph \(sp(S)[H]\) of \(sp(S)\) where
\(|H|= 2^{n-1}\)  and there is a triangle for any tuple of vertices in \(H\), then \(H\) is a halfcomplete.
</div>
<div class= "proof">
Thank Batominovski from StackExchange for a solution  that put a vector space structure on the power set of a set. Here is a sketch:<Br>
We construct a vector space containing elements in \(S\) by  \(V= \mathbb{Z}_2^n\) for which elements in \(V\) with basis \(\{e_s |s \in S\}\).
If \(X \subset S\) then :
\[e_X := \sum_{s \in X} e_s\]
We define an inner product on \(V\) by:
\[ \langle e_X, e_Y \rangle = |X \cap Y| (\mod 2) \]
Then consider:
\[ W:= \mathbb{Z}_2^S - \{e_X |X \in H\}\]
\(W\) is a \(n-1\) dimensional vector subspace of \(\mathbb{Z}_2^n\).
In particular, \(W\) is the kernel of some linear functional from \( \mathbb{Z}_2^S \to \mathbb{Z}_2\)<br>
That linear functional can be represented as inner product with an element \(k \in S\).
Then \(k\) is in intersection of all elements in \(H\).  So \(H\) is a halfcomplete in \(sp(S)\).
</div>

<div class="lemma">
Given a set \(|S| \geq 6\) where for any \(5\) subsets \( s_1,s_2,s_2,s_4,s_5 \subset S\) we have that
\(s_{(i \mod 5)} \cap s_{(i+1 \mod 5)} \neq \emptyset \), then the setpower graph of \(S\) contains a complete graph on \(20\) vertices.
</div>
The lemma is useless as the requirement for the lemma cannot be satisfied.

<div class="definition">
A graph \(G\) whose vertices are \(V(G):= [n] =\{1,2,...,n\} \) for some \(n>0\) is called say, a \(\textbf{number graph} \).

Given a number graph \(G\) whose vertices are \(V(G):= [n]\).
Consider exponential graph \(\mathcal{E}_n(G)\), we want to investigate what happen to \(\mathcal{E}_n(G)\) if we apply
\(a\) to each vertex \(a \in V(\mathcal{E}_n(G)) \).

<div class="definition">
Given number graph \(G\), where \(|V(G)|=n\), we define \(\mathcal{E}_n^2(G) \) as follow:
\[ V(\mathcal{E}_n^2(G)) = \{f \circ f | f \in [n]^{[n]}\}, E(\mathcal{E}_n^2(G)) \text{ is defined as in that of exponential graph}\].
</div>

<div class="lemma">
There are \(n \cdot \binom{n-1}{r} \sum_{r \in [n-1]}\cdot r^{n-r} \) functions in \([n]^{[n]}\) for which composition with themself gives constant function.

A graph \(G\) has a perfect matching if there is a permutation of the rows of its adjacency matrix so that the no-main diagonal are all ones.

<div class="lemma">
(Erdos-Ko-Rado)Given the setpower graph of a set with \(n\) elements, there are clique of size \(\binom{n-1}{r-1}\) for each \(r \leq \frac{n}{2}\).
</div>

<div class ="definition">
Given a graph \(G\) and a set \(S \subset V(G)\), we can construct a boolean function \(f_s :V(G) \to \{0,1\}\) that we can call \(\textbf{Indicator function}\) of \(S\). where
\[f(x) =1 \text{ if } x \in \(S\) \]
  </div>


Do we know what property of the indicator function of subset of the exponential graph of a setpower graph?
<br>
It would also be interesting to look at sensitivity or block sensitivity of a indicator function of some subset of the vertex set of some setpower graph.
<br>
The graph corresponding to a sunflower is a complete graph, but it is not necessary that the converse is true. 
<br>
we can look at perfect e code of a set power graph and see if there is anything to be said about that.
<br>
What is the relationship between setpower graph of a set \(S\) and a hypercube graph? since the vertices in the setpower graph binary string of length \(|S|\), they are also vertices in \(Q^n\) where \(Q^n\) would be a subgraph of \(Sp(S)\).
