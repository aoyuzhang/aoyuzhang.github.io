  <div class ="lemma">
  	(lemma 4)
   Given graph \(|V(G)|=n\), a suited proper \(c\)-coloring \(\Psi\) of \(\mathcal{E}_c(G)\).
   There exist a vertex \(v \in V(G)\) such that more than \(c-\sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}}\) color classes \(b\)
   are \(v\)-robust.
  </div>
  <div class="proof">
  We define \(I(u,b) := \{ \phi \in \Psi^{-1}(b)| \phi(u)=b \} \). Namely, it is the set
  	of \(b\)-colored maps under \(\Psi\) that also maps the vertex \(u \in V(G)\) to color \(b\).
  	<br>
  	\(\textbf{Claim:}\):
  	If the size of \(I(u,b)\) is larger than \(n^2c^{n-2}\), then \(b\) is \(u\)-robust.
  	<br>
  	take \(\phi \in \Psi^{-1}(b)\), if all maps \(\psi_{ub} \in I(u,b) \) contains a vertex \(v \neq u\) such that:
  	\(\psi_{ub}(v) \in Im(\phi) \), then there are at most \(n^2\) choice for \(v, \psi_{ub}(v)\), and \(c^{n-2}\) choices for
  	the colors of the remaining vertices \(V(G)-\{u,v\}\) for a total of at most \(n^2c^{n-2}\) possible maps.
  	Hence the above assumption on the property of \(\psi_{uv}\) must be false as it contradict the size of \(I(u,b)\).
  	Hence there is a map \( \psi_{ub} \in I(u,b) \) where the only vertex mapped to \(b\) is \(u\) as (\(\psi_{ub}(v) \notin Im(\phi), \forall v \neq u \)).
  	But since both \(\psi_{uv}, \phi\) receives the same color \(b\), they must not be adjacent in \(\mathcal{E}_c(G)\). Now, all edges \((x,y)\) in the graph \(G\),
  	where both \(x,y \) are not equals to \(u\), \(\phi(x) \neq \psi_{uv}(y)\) as \(\psi_{uv}(x) \notin Im(\phi)\).
    And so the only way we can make \( \phi ,\psi_{uv} \) be equal on endvertices of an edge is an
  	edge incident to \(u\), say edge \(u,w\). Since \(\phi(u)=\psi_{uv}(u)=b, \psi_{uv}(w) \notin Im(\phi)\), we need that \(\phi(w)=b\) and
  	then we have \(\phi(w)=\psi_{uv}(u)=b \) hence making \(\psi_{uv}, \phi\) adjacent.
  <br>
   Now, suppose we have a vertex \(v \in V(G)\) such that for at least \(c- \sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}}\) colors \(b\), for which \(I(u,b)\) is large, hence \(b\) is \(v\)-robust, then we are done.
   Otherwise, for each vertex \(v \in V(G)\), \(v\) has \( \leq \) \(c- \sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}}\) colors \(b\) for which \(I(u,b)\) is large.
   So let's count the number of maps from \(V(G) to [c]\) for which a vertex \(v\) dosen't receive a color \(b\) for which \(I(u,b)\) is large.
   Then, since each vertex has \( \leq \) \(c- \sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}}\) colors \(b\) for which \(I(u,b)\) is large, then \(v\) has more than \(c - (c- \sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}})=\sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}}\)
   colors \(b\) for which \(I(u,b)\) is not large.  Since there are \(n\) vertices in the graph, so the total number of wanted maps is at least \((\sqrt[n]{n^3c^{n-1}})^n= n^3c^{n-1}\).
  These maps doesn't belongs to any classes \(I(u,b)\) for which \(I(u,b)\) is a large class. but the number elements in the no large classes \(I(u,b)\) is
  at most \(n \cdot c \cdot n^2c^{n-2}= n^3c^{n-1} =n^3c^{n-1} \). So the no larges classes cannot contain all constructed maps, a contradiction. Hence , the claim  must have been true.
