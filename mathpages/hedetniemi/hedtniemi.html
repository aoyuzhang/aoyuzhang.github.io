Hedetniemi conjecture in his PhD thesis that the chromatic number of the categorical product of two graph is the minimum of the chromatic number of the two.

<div class="definition">
Given two graphs \(G=(A,B),H=(X,Y)\), their categorical product(also called tensor product), denoted by \(G \times H\) is defined as:
\[ V(G \times H)=A \times X \]
\[ E(G \times H)= \{((z,x),(c,v)| (z,c) \in B, (x,v) \in Y \} \]
</div>
Example, \(K_3\times P_3\), where \(K_3\) is the complete graph on \(3\) vertices \(\{D,E,F\}\) and \(P_3\) is the path graph on three vertices \(\{A,B,C\}\):

<div id="mynetwork20"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // create an array with nodes
  var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
    { id: 1, label: "AD" },
    { id: 2, label: "AE" },
    { id: 3, label: "AF" },
    { id: 4, label: "BD" },
    { id: 5, label: "BE" },
    { id: 6, label: "BF" },
    { id: 7, label: "CD" },
    { id: 8, label: "CE" },

    { from: 1, to: 6 },
    { from: 2, to: 4 },
    { from: 2, to: 6 },

</script>

<div class="definition">
	Let \(H\), and \(G\) be graphs. The \(\textbf{exponential graph}\) of \(G\) with base \(H\) is denoted \(H^G\), and is it is defined as:
	\[
	\begin{gather*}
	 V(H^G):=V(H)^{V(G)}\\
	 E(H^G):=\{(u,v)| \forall (x,y) \in E(G), (u(x), v(y)) \in E(H)\}
	\end{gather*}
	\]
</div>
  If \(H = K_c\), then we can think of the vertices
  of \(K_c^G \) as colorings of vertices in \(G\) with \(c\) colors where two colorings in \(V(K_c^G)\) are adjacent if they color adjacent vertices in \(G\) with different colors.
  We denote these types of exponential graphs as \(\mathcal{E}_c(G)\).<br>

Example, given length \(3\) path graph \(P_3\) and complete graph on \(2\) vertices \(K_2\):
<div id="mynetwork8"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // create an array with nodes
  var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
    { id: 1, label: "A" },
    { id: 2, label: "B" },
    { id: 3, label: "C" },
    { id: 4, label: "1" ,color: "rgb(234,179,245)"},
    { id: 5, label: "2" , color:"rgb(213,250,178)"}
  ]);

  // create an array with edges
  var edges = new vis.DataSet([
    { from: 1, to: 2 },
    { from: 2, to: 3 },
    { from: 4, to: 5 ,color: "blue"}
  ]);

  // create a network
  var container = document.getElementById("mynetwork8");
  var data = {
    nodes: nodes,
    edges: edges
  };
  var options = {};
  var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>

We think of vertices in \(K_2\) as colors. Say vertex \(1\) correspond to <font color="rgb(234,179,245)">purple</font> color and vertex \(2\) to <font color="rgb(213,250,178)">green</font> color.
<br> A vertex in \(K_2 ^{P_3}=\mathcal{E}_2(P_3)\) is a coloring of vertices of \(P_3\) in two colors:

<div id="mynetwork11"></div>

The two colorings that colors every vertices in \(P_3\) monochromatically are the only colorings forming an edge in \(K_2 ^{P_3}\):

Here, the vertex with label \((A:i,B:j,C:k)\) just means we assign colors \(i,j,k \in \{1,2\}\) to vertices \(A,B,C \in V(G)\).<br>
<br>

<!-- How we use exponential graphs on in the Hedetniemi's Conjecture is as follow: -->


<!-- <div class="lemma">
 Given graphs \(G,H\), and map definined as \( f: G \times K^G \to K \), \(f(u,\phi) = \phi(u)\) is a homomorphism.
</div>
<div class="proof">
Let \( ((u, \phi),(v, \tau)) \in E(G \times K^G) \), then \( f((u, \phi)) =\phi(u), f((v, \tau))=\tau(v) \)
<br>
As \((u,v) \in E(G), (\phi,\tau) \in E(K^G) \Rightarrow (\phi(u) ,\tau(v)) \in E(K)\)
</div> -->

<!-- We first give this lemma:
<div class="lemma">
	(lemma 1)
Given graphs \(G,H,K\), we have \(G \times H \to K \iff H \to K^G\)
</div>
<a href="lemma1.html">proof</a>
<br> -->


<!-- <div class= "definition">
  We define the statement: \(H(n):\) If \(G \times H\) is \(n\)-colorable, then \(G\) or \(H\) is \(n\)-colorable.
</div> -->

<!-- Since \(\chi(G,H) \leq \min(\chi(G),\chi(H)) \),
the Heditmiemi's conjecture is true if and only if \(\chi(G,H) \geq \min(\chi(G),\chi(H)) \) -->

<!-- \(H(n)\) is true for all \(n\).  -->

<!-- <br>
We can use the above lemma to prove the following lemma:
<div class="lemma">
	(lemma 2)
 Hedetniemi's conjecture is equivalent to :
 \[ \chi(G)>n \Rightarrow \chi((K_n)^G) \leq n\]
</div>
<a href="lemma2.html">proof</a>
<br>
If we can find a graph \(G\) such that \(\chi(G)>n\) and also \(\chi((K_n)^G) > n\) then we would have disproven the conjecture.
<br> -->

<div class ="definition">
Given graphs \(G,H\), the \(\textbf{strong product}\) \(G \boxtimes H\) is defined as follow:
\[\begin{gather*}
V(G \boxtimes H)=V(G) \times V(H)\\
E(G \boxtimes H) = \{ ((u,v),(x,y)) |((u,v),(x,y)) \in E(G \times H) \text{ or } ((u,v),(x,y)) \in E(G \square H) \}

We made the coloring of the complete graph \(K_3\) in the strong product so that you can visualize better.
<br> we can really think of \(G \boxtimes K_n\) as \(G\) but each of its verticess is a copy of \(K_n\)
and all possible edges between \((K_n, a), (K_n,b) \) is present if \((a,b) \in E(G)\):

The value \(9\) on each thick edge means there are \(9\) edges between the clusters.
<br>We also need another construction of graphs. We'll denote by \(\Gamma_G\), the graph obtained from \(G\), by adding all loops.
For example, \(\Gamma_{P_3} \) looks like:

	(Observation 1)
Given a graph \(G\) and a proper suited coloring \(f\) of \(V(\mathcal{E}_n(G))\) for some \(n \in \mathbb{N}\),
Then \(f(\phi)  \in Im(\phi) \).
</div>
<div class="proof">
Consider a color \(b \notin Im(\phi) \), then \( (\bar{b}, \phi) \in E(\mathcal{E}_n(G))\). And so \( \phi\) could not have been
given the color \(b\) in a proper suited coloring of \(V(\mathcal{E}_n(G))\).

<div class="definition">
(Shitov). Given a suited colouring \(\phi: (K_n)^G \to [n]\). We know that \(\phi(\alpha) = b \in Im(\alpha)\).  So some vertex of \(G\) is colored \(b\) by \(\alpha\).
If any \(b\) colored map \(\beta \in (K_n)^G\), maps a vertex in \(N[v] \subset V(G)\) to color \(b\), then we say \(b\) is \(v\)-\(\textbf{robust}\).

For example, in the above coloring of \(\mathcal{E}_2(P_3)\), the coor \(2\)(green) is <a href="threedhouse.html">\(B\)-robust</a>



<!--
The idea of the counterexample that Shitov came up with is using the following strategy:
For any suited colouring, there is always a vertex with many robust colours(lemma 4). But Hedetniemi's conjecture will provide us with too many suited colourings and from which we can find one that does not have a vertex with many robust colours. -->

The two ways to color \(P_3 \boxtimes K_3\), where all vertices in the same cluster \((g,K_3)\) receives the same color, can be translated to a coloring of \(\Gamma_{P_3}\):

Here, we are seeing nodes that are within distance \(3\) from the node \(v\). Let's fix \(t \in \{q+1,...,c\}\).
<br>
Let's look at how \(\mu_t\) colors the graph \(G \boxtimes K_q\). For illustration purposes, let's assume \(p=3\) and
<br>
we associate
<br>\(1\) to color purple,
<br>\(2\) to color green
<br> and \(3\) to color yellow.
<br>
Well, if \(u \in V(G)\) is such that \(dist(u,v) \in \{0,2\}\), then \((u,K_q)\) cluster is colored like so:


<div id="mynetwork15"></div>

  // create an array with nodes

  // create an array with edges
  var edges = new vis.DataSet([
    { from: 1, to: 2 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"},
    { from: 3, to: 2 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"},
		{ from: 3, to: 1 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"}

  // create a network
  var container = document.getElementById("mynetwork15");
  var data = {
    nodes: nodes,
    edges: edges
  };
  var options = {};
  var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>
The vertices in the green clusters of the example are all colored like so.
<br>
If if \(u \in V(G)\) is such that \(dist(u,v)=1\), then \((u,K_q)\) cluster is colored like the previous case, but using \(q\) different colors, say:

<div id="mynetwork16"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // create an array with nodes
  var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
    { id: 1, label: "(u,1)" ,value: 3, color: "rgb(0,260,245)"},
    { id: 2, label: "(u,2)" ,value: 3, color: "rgb(113,250,178)"},
    { id: 3, label: "(u,3)" ,value: 3, color: "orange"}
  ]);

  // create an array with edges
  var edges = new vis.DataSet([
    { from: 1, to: 2 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"},
    { from: 3, to: 2 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"},
		{ from: 3, to: 1 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"}
  ]);

  // create a network
  var container = document.getElementById("mynetwork16");
  var data = {
    nodes: nodes,
    edges: edges
  };
  var options = {};
  var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>

The vertices in the yellow clusters of the above example is colored this way.
<br>
Finally, if \(u \in G\) is such that \(dist(u,v) \geq 3\), then the verties in the cluster \((u,K_q)\) is color with the same color \(t\), say:

<div id="mynetwork17"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // create an array with nodes
  var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
    { id: 1, label: "(u,1)" ,value: 3, color: "rgb(0,260,2)"},
    { id: 2, label: "(u,2)" ,value: 3, color: "rgb(0,260,2)"},
    { id: 3, label: "(u,3)" ,value: 3, color: "rgb(0,260,2)"}
  ]);

  // create an array with edges
  var edges = new vis.DataSet([
    { from: 1, to: 2 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"},
    { from: 3, to: 2 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"},
		{ from: 3, to: 1 ,color: "rgb(134,179,245)"}
  ]);

  // create a network
  var container = document.getElementById("mynetwork17");
  var data = {
    nodes: nodes,
    edges: edges
  };
  var options = {};
  var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>

Now, we analyse why \(M := \{\mu_{q+1},...,\mu_c\} \) form a clique(complete graph).
<br>
If we have \((w,i),(u,j)\) where \(dist(u,v) \geq 3\) and \(dist(w,v) \geq 3\)  then they receives different colors under two differrent maps
\(\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\beta}\) as one of them reveives color \(\alpha\) and the other receives color \(\beta\).
<br>
If we have \((w,i),(u,j)\) where \(dist(u,v) = 2\) and \(dist(w,v) \geq 3\)  then they receives different colors under two differrent maps
\(\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\beta}\) as one receives colors in \(\{1,...,q\}\) and the other receives color in \(\{q+1,...,c\}\).
<br>
There are no edges between \( (u,i),(w,j)\) if \(dist(u,v)=2\) and \(dist(w,v)=2\) because the path from \(u\) to \(v\),
the path from \(w\) to \(v\) and edge \((u,v)\) form a cycle of length less than \(6\) which contradict the girth requirment of \(G\).
<br>
If we have \((w,i),(u,j)\) where \(dist(u,v) = 2\) and \(dist(w,v) = 1\)  then they receives different colors under two differrent maps
\(\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\beta}\) as one receives colors in \(\{1,...,q\}\) and the other receives color in \(\{q+1,...,2q\}\).
<br>
There are no edges between \( (u,i),(w,j)\) if \(dist(u,v)=1\) and \(dist(w,v)=1\) as they could form a cycle of length \(3\) in \(G\) violating the girth requirment.
<br>
If we have \((w,i),(v,j)\) where \(dist(w,v) = 1\)  then they receives different colors under two differrent maps
\(\mu_{\alpha}, \mu_{\beta}\) as one receives colors in \(\{1,...,q\}\) and the other receives color in \(\{q+1,...,2q\}\).
<br>

Hence vertices in \(M\) form a clique.
<br>
Now, as \(c = \lceil 3.1 q \rceil \), \(|M| \geq \lceil 3.1q \rceil -q >2q \). So as all vertices in \(M\) receives different colors, there must be
\(\tau \in \{q+1,...,c\}\) such that \(\Lambda(\mu_{\tau}) \notin \{1,...,2q\}\). So since the only possible colors in \(Im(\mu_{\tau})\) that could be
\(\tau\) is in vertices \((u,i)\) where \(dist(u,v) \geq 3\), we have \(\tau\) is not \(v\)-robust. Consider the ratio of number of no \(v\)-robust colors over \(c-2q-1\):

\[ \frac{\sqrt[n]{n^3(3.1q)^{n-1}}}{c-2q-1} = \frac{\sqrt[n]{n^3(3.1q)^{n-1}}}{1.1q} = \frac{n^3(3.1q)^{n-1}}{1.1^n q^n} \to 0 \text{ as } q \to \infty\]

So for large enough \(q\), there must be a color\(\sigma \notin \{1,...,2q,\tau\}\) that is \(v\)-robust.

Consider a map \(\nu : G \boxtimes K_q \to \{1,...,c\}\):
\[\begin{cases}
\nu(g,i) = \tau , \text{ if } g \in N(v) \\
\nu(g,i) = \sigma , \text{ if } dist(v,g) \geq 2
\end{cases}
\]

\(\nu\) is adjacent to \(\mu_{\tau}\) but has the same color as \(\mu_{\tau}\). So that is a contradiction, so \(\chi(\mathcal{E}_c(G \boxtimes K_q)) > c \).

<h2 id = "refu">The counterexample</h2>

Consider graph \(G\) such that girth of \(G\) is at least \(6\) and \(\chi_f(G) > 3.1\).
Existance of such graph \(G\) is garanteed by classical result.
Then we let \(c = \lceil 3.1 q \rceil\) and take \(q\) large enough so that
\[\chi( \mathcal{E}_c(G \boxtimes K_q)) >c \text{(by claim 3) and } \chi((G \boxtimes K_q)) \geq q \cdot \chi_f(G) >c  \]
However,
\[ \chi(\mathcal{E}_c(G \boxtimes K_q) \times (G \boxtimes K_q))=c \]
The last claim is because \(\chi(G \times \mathcal{E}_c(G))=c \) and this is true because of the coloring:
\[ \phi:  V(G \times \mathcal{E}_c(G)) \to [c] \text{ by }  \phi((u,f)) \to f(u) \]
<!-- So this is the proof finally. -->
<!-- <br>


The only thing left is the classical result part and the use of fractional chromatic number part.

<!-- <h2> Some facts about exponential graphs</h2>

<br>
We built a database of examples graph using networkX. We also computed some basic graph properties.
<br>
Partial data can be viewed <a href="pdffiles/grahhhhhh.csv"> here </a>.
<br>
We have made drawings of graphs \(G\) with their \(\mathcal{E}_c(G)\) of some values of \(c\):
<ul>
<li>Here is  <a href="pdffiles/multipage-6.pdf">\(c = 2\)</a> and each page contains the exponential graph on left and the graph on right.</li>
<li>Here is <a href="pdffiles/multipage-9.pdf">\(c = 3\)</a> and each page contains one graph and each graph and its exponential graph appears in adjacent pages. </li>

</ul>

<br>


From the generated examples, we have smart easy remarks:

<div class="lemma">
  The exponential graph \(\mathcal{E}_c(G)\) of the disjoint union of singleton vertices graph \(G\) on \(n\) vertices are complete graphs on \(c^n\) vertices.
</div>
<div class="proof">
  This is because the statement : \(\forall u,v \in c^{[V(R_0^n)]}, \forall (x,y) \in E(R_0^n), u(x) \neq v(y) \wedge v(x) \neq u(y)\) is trivially true.
</div>

<div class="lemma">
 Given a connected graph \(G\), then \(\mathcal{E}_2(G) \) consitsts of an edge and the rest are singleton vertices.
</div>
<div class="proof">
	The edge in \(\mathcal{E}_2(G)\) represents the connection between the trivial maps that map all vertices in \(G\) to one of the two colors.
	<br>
	We break the problem into cases:
	<ol>
		<li> if the \(G\) is just an edge, then this can be verified to satisfy the lemma. </li>
		<li> Otherwise \(G\) has a path of length \(2\).
			<br>
			we want, by contradiction, find a no trivial coloring of \(G\) that is not an isolated vetex in \(\mathcal{E}_2(G)\).
			<br>
			If a coloring of \(V(G)\), where on the path of length \(2\), the middle vertex is adjacent to vertices of different color.
			<br>
			Then that coloring is not adjacent to any other coloring.
			<br>
			This is because no matter how you color the middle vertex, it will have the same color as one of its neighbhor in that path.</li>
		<li> If \(G\) has a cycle of odd lenght, and we have a no triavial coloring of \(G\) then we get back to case \(2\) so we are left with case that  \(G\) must be bipartite.
			<br> By avoiding case \(2\) means we can only give proper coloring of \(G\),
			<br>
			but a proper coloring of a bipartite graph can only be adjacent to itself in \(\mathcal{E}_2(G)\) so it is again an isolated vertex in \(\mathcal{E}_2(G)\).
		</li>
	</ol>
   So all no trivial coloring of \(V(G)\) are not connected to any other colorings. So claim in the lemma must be true.
</div>


<h2> Alternative ways </h2>
<div class="definition">
The \(\textbf{Hajos sum}\) of graphs \(G\) and \(H\) with respect to edges \(ab \in E(G)\)
and \(xy \in E(H)\), is the graph obtained from the disjoint union of \(G\) and \(H\)
by contracting the vertices \(a\) and \(x\), removing the edges \(ab\) and \(xy\), and joining \(b\) with \(y\)
</div>
Let see an example, we let the path \(E-D-F\) be the graph \(G\) and the cycle \(B-A-C-B\) be the graph \(H\).
then the Hajos sum with respect to edges \(ED\) and \(BA\) is:

<div id="mynetwork14"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // create an array with nodes
  var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
    { id: 1, label: "EB" },
    { id: 2, label: "C" },
    { id: 3, label: "A" },
    { id: 4, label: "D" },
    { id: 5, label: "F" }
  ]);

  // create an array with edges
  var edges = new vis.DataSet([
    { from: 1, to: 2 },
    { from: 2, to: 3 },
    { from: 3, to: 4 },
    { from: 4, to: 5 }
  ]);

  // create a network
  var container = document.getElementById("mynetwork14");
  var data = {
    nodes: nodes,
    edges: edges
  };
  var options = {};
  var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>



<div class="definition">
	A graph \(G\) is called \(\textbf{multiplicative}\) if for all graphs \(F,H\),
	if \(F \nrightarrow G\) and \(H \nrightarrow G\), then \(F \times H \nrightarrow G\).
</div>
It is not known wether the problem of asserting if a graph is multiplicative or not is decidable or not.
Exponential graphs are the best tools to study the multiplicative graphs.
<div class= "definition">
Fix integer \(n\), a graph \(G\) is called \( \textbf{Persistent}\), if \(\chi(G \times H)=n+1 \) for any graph \(H\) with \(\chi(H)=n+1\).
</div>

<div class= "definition">
 A graph \(G\) is called \(\textbf{Strongly persistent} \) if it is persistent and the Hajos sum with any persistent graph is also persistent.
</div>

<div class="definition">
	for a given set of graphs, we refer to the following operations:
	<ul>
     <li>Hajos sum</li>
		 <li>Adding vertices and edges</li>
		 <li>Contracting nonadjacent vertices</li>
  </ul>
	as the \(\textbf{three operations}\)
</div>

The three operations will not decrease the chromatic number
<div class="theorem">
	(Sauer and Zhu) If graph \(G\) is constructed using the three oprations on copies of \(K_{n+1}\),
	and if at most one contraction is perfomed, then \(G\) is strongly persistent.
	Futhermore, Hajos sum of strongly persistent graphs is a strongly persistent graph.

</div>

The Hedetmiemi's conjecture is equivalent to the statement: The Hajos sum of persistent graphs is persistent.

<!-- <h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is a typo in Claim2 of the paper by Shitov where in the beginning, it should be "Consider a graph \(\Gamma\) with \(|V(\Gamma)|=n\)"</li>
<li>In the second paragraph of the proof of Claim2 in the paper by Shitov, the conclusion that "\( \Psi(\varphi)=b\) cannot hold unless there is a vertex \( w  \in N(u)\)
	satisfying \(\varphi(w)=b\) " seems to be not true if \(N(u)\) was to be considered the closed neighbehood of \(u\). As we could have set \(\varphi(u)=b\) and
	\( \varphi(v) \neq b , \forall v \in V(G)-\{u\} \).We can verify that since \(u\) is the only vertex where \(\psi_{ub}(u)=b\). and
	\(\psi_{ub}(u') \neq \varphi(u') \forall u' \neq u\), then \(\varphi, \psi_{ub}\) are connected and receives the same color under \(\Psi\), a contradiction.
	  Nevertheless, the argument could probably (don't understand yet) work in different way as shown in a paper by Shinko.
